{"blogs":[{"title":"Freshman Internship at Amazon!","body":"I'm excited to receive my first ever internship offers. I've received two offers before accepting this school year. I received an offer from EControls, a local company based in San Antonio for an IoT Software Development internship. The company seemed great, and I thoroughly enjoyed my day-long interview with them, meeting the small team, touring the large production plant they had there alongside the offices, and meeting the recruiting team. I definitely would have accepted this offer, if not for an offer from Amazon for their Software Development Internship in LA. I will list the details of my internship search for this school year (2021-2022) below.\r\n\r\n~100 Applications\r\n24 Online Assignments\r\n6 Interviews\r\n\tCampus Internship\r\n\tHubspot\r\n\tForeflight\r\n\tExpedia\r\n\tEControls\r\n\tAmazon\r\n2 Offers\r\n\tEControls\r\n\tAmazon\r\nDeclined Interviews (After accepted Amazon offer)\r\n\tForeflight\r\n\tExpedia\r\n\r\n( will want to probably do some graphs here, maybe some d3 )\r\n\r\nSuper excited to have received an offer from Amazon in Los Angeles, and get OAs and interviews with any of these companies.
